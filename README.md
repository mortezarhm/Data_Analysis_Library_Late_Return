# Library Book Return Analysis

Welcome to the **Library Book Return Analysis** repository! This project aims to analyze the factors influencing the late return rates of books in various library branches in Oregon. By leveraging data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models, I identify key trends and provide actionable recommendations to mitigate late returns.

## Introduction
This repository contains the analysis and findings of a study conducted to understand the factors contributing to late book returns in library branches across Oregon. The objective is to identify patterns and provide data-driven recommendations to improve return rates and enhance library operations.

## Data Collection
The data for this analysis was collected from various sources, including library transaction records, demographic information, and geographical data. The main datasets used in this analysis include:
- Book checkout and return records
- Patron demographic data (age, gender, education level, occupation)
- Library branch information
- Geographical data of library branches and patrons

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved several steps to ensure the datasets were accurate and ready for analysis:
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing date formats
- Removing duplicates
- Creating new columns to indicate late returns and categorize patrons

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to uncover initial insights and understand the distribution of late returns across various factors. Key steps included:
- Calculating overall late return rates
- Visualizing late return rates by library branch, education level, and gender
- Analyzing seasonal trends in late returns
- Mapping the geographical distribution of late returns

## Modeling
Machine learning models were developed to predict late returns and identify important factors influencing return behavior. The following models were used:
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Ensemble model (combining multiple classifiers)

Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, F1 score, specificity, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).

## Results
The analysis revealed several key findings:

### Overall Late Return Rate
The overall late return rate was found to be 9.1%, indicating that a majority of patrons return books on time.

### Geographical Distribution of Late Returns
- **Heatmap**: A heatmap showed higher concentrations of late returns in downtown Portland and near the Portland International Airport, suggesting regional operational or accessibility issues.
- **Black Dot Map**: This map displayed the distribution of all returns, highlighting areas with higher library activity.

### Seasonal Analysis
- **Bar Chart**: Late return rates varied across seasons, with winter having the highest rate (11.95%), followed by summer (10.10%), spring (8.65%), and autumn (8.11%).

### ROC Curve and Model Performance
- The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest AUC (0.86), followed by the ensemble model (0.85), indicating strong performance in predicting late returns.

### Confusion Matrices
- The confusion matrices for different classifiers provided insights into their prediction performance that highlights the strengths of the Random Forest and ensemble models.

## Discussion
The results indicate that demographic, seasonal, and geographical factors can potentially impact late return rates. For instance, winterâ€™s high late return rate could be due to harsh weather conditions, while the geographical distribution points to potential operational inefficiencies in specific areas.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed to mitigate late returns:
1. **Branch-specific Strategies**: Implement targeted reminder systems and flexible return policies for branches with high late return rates.
2. **Educational Outreach**: Develop programs to educate patrons about the importance of timely returns, which targets demographics with higher late return rates.
3. **Gender-specific Interventions**: Investigate the reasons behind gender differences in late returns and design appropriate interventions.
4. **Enhanced Data Monitoring**: Continuously monitor return patterns and update strategies based on real-time data analysis.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning models to identify patrons at risk of returning books late and proactively engage them with reminders and support.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides an understanding of the aspects influencing late book returns in Oregon's library branches. By implementing the recommended strategies, libraries can improve operational efficiency and enhance user satisfaction, reducing late return rates and ensuring better resource management.
